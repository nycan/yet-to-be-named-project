# Non-CS person
- breaks when above 1
- falls over when changing directions
- Isen wuz heer
- steps are small when at high speeds
- the robot actually walks better backwards
- good contact with edge boundaries
- The addition of a checkerboard floor made the simulation much more visually appealing
- The robot's visuals could have been improved, though it served its purpose effectively
- An indicator of the robot's front and back ends could prove useful in other demonstrations considering both backwards and forwards movement; this would also help when comparing different leg designs, ie. forward/backward knee bend
- The inclusion of friction to replicate real-life situations was very creative
- Eyesen rulz

# CS person
- didn'tw work first try
- Worked second try, and the robot is capable of walking forwards and backwards
- After about 10 or so seconds, the robot began to destabilize and tip over
- Could be better if it can walk faster
- really slow and looks kinda of dumb
- but the legs were pretty realistic
